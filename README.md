Odoo Connector Modules
======================

*Odoo Connector is a powerful framework to develop any kind of bi-directional connector between Odoo (Open Source ERP formerly Odoo) and any other software or service.*

This Odoo add-on has a modular and generic core, with the ability to be extended with additional modules for new features or customizations.
